## Usage

To insert the image URI `amazon/amazon-ecs-sample:latest` as the image for the `web` container in the task definition file, and then deploy the edited task definition file to ECS:

```yaml
    - name: Render Amazon ECS task definition
      id: render-web-container
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition@v1
      with:
        task-definition: task-definition.json
        container-name: web
        image: amazon/amazon-ecs-sample:latest
        secrets: true

    - name: Deploy to Amazon ECS service
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v1
      with:
        task-definition: ${{ steps.render-web-container.outputs.task-definition }}
        service: my-service
        cluster: my-cluster
```

If your task definition file holds multiple containers in the `containerDefinitions`
section which require updated image URIs, chain multiple executions of this action
together using the output value from the first action for the `task-definition`
input of the second:

```yaml
    - name: Render Amazon ECS task definition for first container
      id: render-web-container
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition@v1
      with:
        task-definition: task-definition.json
        container-name: web
        image: amazon/amazon-ecs-sample-1:latest

    - name: Modify Amazon ECS task definition with second container
      id: render-app-container
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition@v1
      with:
        task-definition: ${{ steps.render-web-container.outputs.task-definition }}
        container-name: app
        image: amazon/amazon-ecs-sample-2:latest

    - name: Deploy to Amazon ECS service
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v1
      with:
        task-definition: ${{ steps.render-app-container.outputs.task-definition }}
        service: my-service
        cluster: my-cluster
```

If you choose to add environment variables using the "secrets" input, add the secrets input
and set it to `true` in your GitHub workflow and add the secrets section to your 
[task definition](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ecs-data-security-container-task/).
The "valueFrom" should include this specific format:

```
{
    "name": "var-from-parameter-store",
    "valueFrom": "ssm:path/to/variable"
}
{
    "name": "var-from-secrets-manager",
    "valueFrom": "secretsmanager:path/to/variable"
}
```

Notice the "ssm" and "secretsmanager" prefix, both of which are followed by a ":" (colon) and variable path.

See [action.yml](action.yml) for the full documentation for this action's inputs and outputs.
